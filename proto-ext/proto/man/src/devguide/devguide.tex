\section{Overview}

Proto is a language designed for implementing distributed systems on
spatially-structured networks of static or mobile devices.  The
programmer describes a desired behavior for the continuous space
occupied by the network, which can be translated into a program by
which individual devices cooperate to produce an approximation of the
desired behavior.  Such programs can then be rendered into an
executable than can run equivalently on different hardware platforms.

\paragraph{Components}
MIT Proto is an implementation of Proto which supplies four main
components:
\begin{itemize}
\item A compiler which turns Proto code into executable code for
  individual devices
\item A library of Proto code implementing commonly used functions
\item An implementation of the ProtoKernel virtual machine, one means
  of executing programs on individual devices.
\item An event-based simulator, based on ProtoKernel, for debugging
  and visualization of Proto programs executing on a network
\end{itemize}

MIT Proto is typically invoked through one of two executables,
{\tt p2b} and {\tt proto}.  The name {\tt p2b} stands for ``Proto
to bytecode'' and is a standalone invocation of the compiler.  The
{\tt proto} executable, on the other hand, first compiles and then
executes in the simulator.

% In simulator:
%   command line --> set of plugins, code, simulator platform file
%      code --> compiler --> bytecode
%      create VMs w. distribution, time model
%      event-based simulation: device evolution, layer evolution

% In real devices:
%   commandline + platform file --> p2b --> bytecode
%     devices compiled w. platform kernel
%     inject bytecode to one device, spreads virally


\paragraph{Extensions}
MIT Proto has interfaces allowing this system to be extended in three
ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The compiler can emit code customized to different platforms
\item ProtoKernel can incorporate a set of platform-specific opcodes 
\item The simulator supports plug-in:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Distributions for laying out the devices of a network (e.g.
      random, grid, torus).
    \item Models for the evolution of time on individual devices (e.g. 
      synchronous, drifting clocks)
    \item Physics ``layers'' for simulating the interaction of sensors
      and actuators with aspects of a dynamic external enviroment
      (e.g. wireless communication, chemical diffusion, Newtonian
      kinetics, LEDs and beeps)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

MIT Proto's is copylefted such that any modification of its components
is copylefted as well, but extensions need not be.

\section{Installed File Locations}

MIT Proto uses autotools to build and install on a machine.  By
default, the installation directory prefix is {\tt /usr/local/} (or
the OS-appropriate equivalent).  From this base, the following default
locations are used (reconfigurable via {\tt ./configure} when the project
is being built):

\begin{itemize}
\item Executables are placed in {\tt PREFIX/bin/}
\item The library files in the build directories {\tt lib/} and {\tt
    /lib/core/} are both placed into \\{\tt PREFIX/share/proto/lib}.
  This directory is part of the default search path for executions of
  the compiler.
\item Opcode definition files for platform PLATFORM are expected 
  to be found in \\{\tt PREFIX/share/proto/platforms/PLATFORM}
\item The header files needed for building extensions for MIT Proto
  are installed in \\{\tt PREFIX/include/proto/}.
\item The simulator searches for plug-ins in \\{\tt PREFIX/lib/proto/}
\end{itemize}

\section{Compiler}

This document describes only the compiler's interactions with other
pieces of the installation and its major known bugs.  The internal
structure of the compiler will not be documented in detail at this
time, because it is both highly complex and obsolete.

\paragraph{Compiling for a Platform}
The compiler loads platform-specific operations during its
initialization.  When given a \var{--platform {\it PLATFORM}}
argument, it reads the opcode definition file {\tt
  platform\_ops.proto} from the platform directory for {\it PLATFORM}
(see above).  If given no \var{--platform} argument, it assumes the
platform is \var{sim}, for the Proto simulator.

This is a Proto file and is expected to contain a set of \var{defop}
expressions of the form: \code{(defop ? {\it function-name} {\it type}
  ...)}  where {\it function-name} is the Proto function that will
invoke the opcode.  The first {\it type} expression specifies the
return type, and any others that follow specify argument types for the
operator.  The {\it type} expressions are currently allowed only to be
one of \var{scalar}, \var{boolean}, and \var{(vector 3)}.

In addition, for each \var{-L {\it OPFILE}} argument, the compiler
loads the opcode definition file {\it OPFILE} (appending a {\tt
  .proto} extension if needed) from the same directory.

\paragraph{Compilation and Files}

Compilation always starts with a Proto expression on the command line.
Except for the smallest of programs, this expression is not
self-contained.  Whenever the compiler encounters a function {\it
  name} that it does not know, it searches for a file called \var{{\it
    name}.proto} in the directories listed in its path.  By default,
the path consists of the current directory and the installed library
location.  These two command line arguments: \code{--path {\it PATH}}
\code{--basepath {\it PATH}} add to the default path and override the
default path, respectively.

\paragraph{Known Bugs}
Important known bugs in the current compiler are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables in a \var{letfed} that are not used within the body
  of the \var{letfed} are not updated correctly.
\item Variables in \var{let} statements that are used only within a
  conditional further on in the code are inlined inside that
  conditional, which makes side effects of the computation in the
  \var{let} happen only in the domain of that branch of the
  conditional.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Neocompiler}

A complete rebuild of the compiler is in progress, but not currently
checked into the repository. When complete, it will implement an
enhanced version of Proto, fix a number of known compiler bugs, change
how platform-specific opcodes are handled, and allow compilation for
execution on systems other than ProtoKernel.  \fixme{}

\section{Libraries}

MIT Proto includes two libraries: the functions in {\tt lib/} are
moderately complex programs that make useful buiding blocks, while the
functions in {\tt lib/core/} are language primitives implemented in
Proto.  They are mixed together in installation, but kept separate in
the build so that maintenance of the ``library'' collection is not
cluttered up by the large numbers of simple core functions like
\var{log10} and \var{logn}.  The core library exists because it helps
minimize the number of opcodes needed without hardwiring definitions
into the compiler.

\subsection{Adding Simulated Hardware}

\section{Adding Simulator Functionality}

As previously noted, the simulator can be extended with new
distributions for laying out device positions, models for the
evolution of time on individual devices, and physics ``layers'' for
simulating interaction with an external environment.  

Extensions are dynamically loaded from libraries in the plugin
directory.  Also living in that directory is a file, {\bf
  registry.txt}, that contains the current known inventory of plugins.
This file is a case-sensitive list of mappings in a simple key/value format:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each line has format {\tt TYPE NAME = FILESTEM}.  Whitespace (or its
  absence) will be ignored.
\item Lines beginning with {\tt \#}' are comments
\end{itemize}
This file is used to determine what dynamic library should be loaded
to retrieve a desired plugin.  The \var{TYPE} is one of \var{Layer},
\var{TimeModel}, or \var{Distribution}, and the
\var{NAME} and \var{FILESTEM} are arbitrary alphanumeric tokens.  When
the spatial computer is being constructed, a component is looked up
first by type, then by name (components of different type can have the
same name without conflict), to find what library should be loaded.  A
system-appropriate extension is then added to the \var{FILESTEM}
(e.g. \var{.dylib}, \var{.so}, or \var{.dll}) and the library loaded
dynamically.

A library must contain two symbols, which will be invoked as C functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{char* get\_proto\_plugin\_inventory()}
\item \code{ProtoPluginLibrary* get\_proto\_plugin\_library()}
\end{itemize}

The \var{get\_proto\_plugin\_inventory} function returns a C string
containing its portion of the registry file.

The \var{get\_proto\_plugin\_library} function returns an accessor
object for the dynamically loaded library.  This must be subclassed
from the type \var{ProtoPluginLibrary}, which is defined:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
class ProtoPluginLibrary {
 public:
  // Used to get simulator Layers, Distributions, and TimeModels
  virtual void* get_sim_plugin(string type, string name, Args* args, 
                               SpatialComputer* cpu, int n) { return NULL; }
  // Used to get compiler extensions
  virtual void* get_compiler_plugin(string type, string name, Args* args) 
    {return NULL; }
};
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Each of the functions in this interface is used to poll whether a
desired extension object can be obtained from this plugin.  The
function should return the requested object if it can supply it, and
\var{NULL} if not.  The argument \var{type} is its category (e.g
``Layer''), \var{name} is an identifier the desired object, \var{args}
is the current command line arguments, \var{cpu} is the model under
construction, and \var{n} is the number of devices to be created.  The
function may consume command-line arguments, but must not modify the
model directly.

The plugin manager also exposes its own plugin retrieval function, so
that ``meta-plugins'' can combine together the functions of other
objects.  This consists of \var{get\_sim\_plugin} and
\var{get\_compiler\_plugin} functions formatted identically to those
of the \var{ProtoPluginLibrary}.

For example, a multi-radio communication model could use the
\var{get\_sim\_plugin} function to fetch a layer to model each radio
on the device.

Layers, time models, and distributions are invoked by the command line
arguments \code{-L {\it layer}} \code{-TM {\it time-model}} \code{-DD
  {\it distribution}}  

During the construction of the spatial computer model, these command
line arguments are used to find what object is desired.  The
simulator's plugin manager reads the registry to determine what
library the object should be found in, links in the library if it is
not already, then uses the \var{get\_sim\_plugin} to retrieve the
object.

There is currently no facility to handle plugins built with
conflicting names (though objects of different type are each in their
own namespace).

\paragraph{Note:}
GNU compilers have severe limitation with respect to linking
libraries.  In particular, the compiler requires that there must 'not'
be any circular dependency between libraries or there must be a
hierarchical dependency between any two libraries.  Hence utmost care
must be taken to 'not' introduce any circular dependencies between
libraries and beware of the order in which libraries are specified in
makefiles.

\subsection{Layer Opcode Extensions}

Simulator layers can also extend the simulator functionality by
adding new opcodes to the kernel and new functions to the language.
This is accomplished by means of the function:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
SimulatedHardware::registerOpcode(OpHandlerBase* opHandler);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
where the argument passed is an instance of the \var{OpHandler} template
class:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
template <class Tclass> class OpHandler : public OpHandlerBase {
 private:
  void (Tclass::*fnp)(MACHINE* machine);
  Tclass* pThis;
 public:
  OpHandler(Tclass* _pThis, void (Tclass::*_fnp)(MACHINE* machine), const char* _defop) {
    fnp = _fnp;
    pThis = _pThis;
    defop = _defop;
  }
  virtual void operator()(MACHINE* machine) {
    (*pThis.*fnp)(machine);
  }
};
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Basically, an \var{OpHandler} is created specialized for a particular
layer, and maps a declaration of the new Proto functions name and type
to a C++ function invoked on that layer instance.

For example, the \var{SimpleDynamics} layer adds a new opcode for measuring
the radius of a device by invoking
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
parent->hardware.registerOpcode(new OpHandler<SimpleDynamics>(this, &SimpleDynamics::radius_get_op, "radius scalar"));
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
where \var{parent} is the enclosing \var{SpatialComputer} and
\var{radius\_get\_op} is its implementation of the opcode.


\section{Regression Testing}

MIT Proto comes with a built in regression test suite, located in {\tt
  src/tests/}.  The file {\tt prototest.py} is a Python script for
executing tests, and files ending in {\tt .test} are particular test suites.

A test suite is invoked by running: \code{./prototest.py $suite$.test}
Multiple test suites can be given; for example, \code{./prototest.py
  *.test} will execute every test in the directory.

The regression tester works by executing either {\tt proto} or {\tt
  p2b}, capturing its output as a file (by default stored in {\tt
  src/tests/dumps/}), then comparing the contents of this file against
values specified for the test.

The command to be executed for a test is specified as: \code{test:
  \$({\it app}) {\it arguments}} where {\it app} is either \var{PROTO}
or \var{P2B}.  The arguments \var{-D} and \var{-dump-stem} are
supplied automatically if the test does not supply them explicitly,
and \var{-headless} is added for tests invoking the simulator.

Following the executable specification is a series of lines specifying
comparisons to perform on the output of the execution.  Each line is
formatted: \code{{\it test} {\it line} {\it column} {\it
    expected-value} [{\it additional-args}]}

The {\it line} and {\it column} values specify which output token is to
be compared, counting from zero, and splitting each line into
``columns'' on whitespace.  The {\it column} can also have the special
value \var{\_}, meaning that the comparison should be performed
against the entire line (trimming leading and following whitespace,
but leaving the interior intact).

The {\it test} specifies how the {\it expected-value} is to be
compared to the actual value found at {\it line} and {\it column}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \var{=}, \var{>}, \var{<}, \var{>=}, \var{<=}, and \var{!=}
  treat the value as a scalar number and perform the appropriate
  numerical comparison.  Note that comparison with infinity can be
  done by giving an expected value of \var{Inf} or \var{-Inf}.
\item \var{\textasciitilde =} treats the value as a number and tests for approximate
  equality, using an additional argument {\it tolerance} for how
  different the value can be from {\it expected-value}.
\item \var{is\_nan} checks whether the value is equal to the special
  floating point ``not a number'' value (needed because, by IEEE
  standards, \var{NaN} is not equal to itself).  An {\it
    expected-value} must be supplied, but is ignored.
\item \var{is} treats the value as a string and performs a
  case-insensitive comparison with {\it expected-value}
  (e.g. ``OUTPUT'', ``Output'', and ``output'' all match).
\end{itemize}
  
A test succeeds if the executable terminates normally (exit code 0)
and if all comparisons return true.

For each file \var{$suite$.test}, a summary of test results is printed
on standard out and full detail is output into a file
\var{$suite$.test.RESULTS}.

Other notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lines beginning with \var{//} are treated as comments.
\item Default paths and other options in {\tt prototest.py} can be
  changed using various command line arguments.  These options can
  be listed by running {\tt ./prototest.py -h}
\end{itemize}
