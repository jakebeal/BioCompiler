Proto approximates integration over fields by sampling the field at
discrete points, finding its value at each of the discrete set of
neighbours and multiplying that by a discrete approximation to the
manifold's volume element (`infinitesimal volume') at that point:

   (int-hood f) ~= (sum-hood (* f (infinitesimal)))

The geometrically nicest approximation of the volume element at a node
would be the area of that node's Voronoi cell intersected with its
disc of radio communication.  However, we don't have that information,
the disc of radio communication is very approximate, and there are
screw cases.

Instead, we estimate that each node's Voronoi cell will occupy
approximately the same fraction of its disc of radio communication as
all its neighbours.  Hence the current definition of machine_area in
the Proto kernel: divide the volume of the disc of radio communication
by the number of nodes in it (i.e., one more than the number of
neighbours).
