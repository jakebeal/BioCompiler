;; Run this command:
;;  proto "(ring)" -l -n 500
;;
;; then click on one device and hit 't' to initiate a ring.  Green
;; lights will turn on, then off again, propagating outward from the
;; device you clicked.  You can initiate more rings by hitting 't'
;; more: every time you turn the orange light on, another right will
;; start.
