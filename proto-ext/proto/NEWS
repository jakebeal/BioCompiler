Release 6:
- "Thinking in Proto" has a detailed explanation of fields.
- Plugin is included for ODE physics simulation, including 
  XML scripting to creating a model of body and joints
- uninstalled plugins can be used with --DLL argument
- default command-line arguments are read from ./.proto and ~/.proto
  standalone compiler reads from ./.p2b and ~/.p2b
- proto mode for vim; emacs proto mode improved
- build is possible on cygwin again; plugins not yet working on cygwin
- fixed a build problem that affected Fedora and some other Linuxes
- partial documentation of the Proto internal API can be built with doxygen
- various small bugfixes

Release 5:
- "Thinking In Proto" tutorial added to manuals
- Ubuntu build problems fixed
- tests reorganized into neocompiler & paleocompiler versions
- demos updated, local-average.proto added
- various small bugfixes

Release 4:
- The (partially complete) new compiler is available and merged into
  Proto.  You can build proto to use it by configuring with the option
  "--with-neocompiler"
- Plugin visualizations can use user-configurable palettes, just like
  the main simulator
- Emitter plugins are supported for the neocompiler
- prototest is now part of the installation, can be executed from
  arbitrary directories, and uses the installed apps by default
- any-hood+, all-hood+ are working in old compiler; gradient fixed to
  use any-hood+, removing "hop-to-infinity" bug for isolated devices
- Added hexagonal grid distribution, -DD hexgrid
- Corrected axis distortion of grid distributions
- Corrected makefile problems for linux systems
- Small manual updates

Release 3:
- Proto now has a plugin system, allowing both the compiler and
  simulator to be extended with separately built dynamic libraries.
  Among other things, this means it is now much easier to maintain
  multiple possible applications of Proto.
- Various small bug fixes

Release 2:
- Autotools build now less fragile.
- Various small bug fixes

Release 1: 
- Cross-platform build now uses GNU autotools; Proto installs like an 
  ordinary application.
- Various small bug fixes

Release 0:
- Initial release of Proto.
