This project contains an MIT Proto plugin that provides physics
simulation using the ODE physics engine.  It also allows Proto to
create structures of devices connected by DOE joints by means of a
distribution that reads blueprints from XML files.

DEPENDENCIES:

* MIT Proto (v. 1.5 or later)
* ODE (v. 0.11)
* xercesc3 (C++ XML parser, v.3.0 or later)
* pkg-config

INSTALLATION NOTES:

This project uses GNU autotools, so if you have already installed MIT
Proto, you should be able to build it by running:
  `./autogen.sh; ./configure; make; make install'

You may need to add options such as "--with-x" and "--with-glut" when
you run "./configure" if the configuration software does not
automatically detect your graphics correctly.

If you are using a standard install of Mac OS X, you need to add the
option "--with-apple-opengl-framework" when you run "./configure":
  "./configure --with-apple-opengl-framework"

Test the plugin by running:
  proto -L odedynamics -m "(mov (* -0.01 (coord)))" -n 10
This should result in a collection of devices, represented by boxes,
moving toward the center of the screen and colliding.  Initially, they
are blue, but when they touch they turn green instead.
