This project contains a JavaScript implementation of Proto.  
It is based on porting the MIT Proto simulator and the DelftProto VM
to JavaScript.  Compilation is handled by call-outs to a CGI

This is a highly experiment project, and should be considered as early Beta.


To Install on a Server:
1) svn co <PROTO/trunk>
2) compile proto (via instructions in SVN repo)
3) copy webproto/webcompiler into CGI directory (e.g., /usr/lib/cgi-bin) and edit as necessary


Additional component notes:

- p2b is a python script that is meant to handle calls via CGI.
  put it in your system's CGI folder (e.g., /usr/lib/cgi-bin),
  make sure to enable CGI, and point it to your JSON-enabled
  version of the proto p2b

- ace is the library that we're using to display/edit code.
  We added a syntax highlighting module, ace/mode-proto.js
