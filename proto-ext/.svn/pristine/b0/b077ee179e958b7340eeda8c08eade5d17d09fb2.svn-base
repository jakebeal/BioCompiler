      <p><i>Q: Why are you here?</i></p>
      <p>We hope that it's because you want to learn about effective
	programming of distributed systems, and about how the Proto
	language makes this possible.</p>
      <p>Only you, of course, can supply the true answer...</p>

      <h1>Assumptions about the Reader</h1>
      <p>
      In writing this tutorial, we have made several assumptions about
      you as a reader.  First, we assume that you are either entirely
      new to programming or at least unfamiliar with Lisp-like
      languages and with many programming concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
      Whether or not you are already an experienced programmer, it is
      important to realize that Proto is not like most other
      programming languages.  Although Proto is similar to other
      languages in many ways, the ways of thinking that are encouraged
      by Proto are considerably different, because Proto allows its
      user to think both about individual devices separately, and also
      about entire collections of interacting devices as an aggregate.
      Proto is also different because it encourages you to write
      programs in terms of the continuous space your devices are
      distributed through and the continuous period of time when they
      are operating.
      </p>
      <p>
      For most people, even once they've started writing Proto
      code, it's a big jump to change how you're thinking and really
      take advantage of Proto's aggregate view and continuous
      space/time model.  This tutorial will hopefully help you make
      that jump.

      <h1>What is Proto?</h1>
      <p>
      Proto is a language that makes it easy to write complex programs for
      <i>spatial computers</i>.  
      </p>

      <p>
      A <b>spatial computer</b> is a collection of devices distributed to fill space,
      where the difficulty of communicating between devices is strongly
      dependent on their distance. Examples of spatial computers include sensor networks,
      robotic swarms, cells during morphogenesis, FPGAs, ad-hoc wireless
      systems, biofilms, and distributed control systems.
      </p>

      <img src="figures/continuousModel.jpg" width="45%" />
      <img src="figures/discreteModel.jpg" width="45%" />

      <p>
      Proto is a language for programming spatial computers using a continuous
      space abstraction. Rather than describe the behavior of individual
      devices, the programmer views the space filled by the devices as an
      <i>amorphous medium</i> &mdash; a region of continuous space with a computing device
      at every point &mdash; and describes the behavior of regions of space. These
      programs are automatically transformed into local actions that are
      executed approximately by the actual network of devices. When the program
      obeys the abstraction, these local actions reliably produce an
      approximation of the desired aggregate behavior.
      </p>

      <h1>Using WebProto</h1>
      <p>
      WebProto is the first version of Proto that runs entirely in a web
      browser.  It requires that you're running a recent web browser with some
      HTML5 support and WebGL.  We suggest using a recent version of
      <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or 
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a>.
      For other browsers, see the list of 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">which browsers
      support WebGL</a>
      or <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation">this
      page on getting a WebGL implementation.</a>  Furthermore,
      WebProto will function best in an environment with hardware
      acceleration for graphics.
      </p>

      <p>
      The first time you use WebProto, it may load slowly while the
      application code is downloaded by your web browser.  After
      that, however, it should be cached and run much more quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you open WebProto, you'll see a screen such as:
      </p>

      <img src="figures/WebProtoIDE.png" width="78%" />

      <p>
      The gray pane on the right is the <i>Code Pane</i>.  That is where you
      enter the Proto program.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The empty black pane on the left is the <i>Simulator Pane</i>.
      That is where the program will be simulated when you "Run" it.
      To run the program, click the "Run Program" button in the top right.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      When you run the program, you'll see some devices appear in the
      <i>Simulator Pane</i>.
      </p>
      
      <img src="figures/WebProtoIDE-running.png" width="78%" />
      
      <p>
      To navigate around the 3-D Simulator Pane, you can click-and-drag to
      move or scroll to zoom.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      If at any time, you want to pause the execution of the Proto VM, just
      hit the space-bar.  Hit the space-bar again to unpause.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <b>Note:</b> A current limitation of the simulator is that, once
      executing, the page must be reloaded before you can edit the code and
      re-run.  Be aware that, when the page reloads, it will reload with the
      program that was displayed when the page originally loaded (not the
      currently-running program).

      <h1>Errors</h1>
      <p>
      Compilation errors should give hints to help you debug your
      program.  They are presented in red at the top of the screen if they occur.

      <p>
      Comments are useful for helping other people to understand your code.
      Comments, however, do not change the way your program behaves.
      </p>

      <p>
      In Proto, comments are everything after a semi-colon (";").

      <h1>Language Essentials</h1>
      <p>
      Here are some essentials to the Proto language, along with the most
      frequently used functions.
      </p>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
      Proto is a purely functional language. Proto is written using s-expressions in a manner very
      similar to Lisp. Evaluating a Proto expression produces a program: a dataflow graph that may be
      evaluated against a space to produce an evolving field of values at every point on the space.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Types</h2>
      <p>
      All Proto expressions produce fields that map every point in space to a value. The values
      produced are categorized into four basic types: fields, lambdas, tuples, and scalars.
      Booleans are represented as scalars that evaluate to 0 when false, or
      anything else (true).
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="datatypes" class="editor">;; Data Types
(tup 0 1 2.2)
</div></div>

      <p>
      While this isn't very interesting to see executing, it assigns the value
      <tt>[0 1 2.2]</tt> to the entire space (and therefore, each of devices).
      </p>

      </article>

      <article>
      <h1>Nesting</h1>
      <p>
      Data-types, logic, functions, etc. can all be nested.  A good example is
      a tuple-of-tuples:
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="nesting" class="editor">;; Nesting
(tup 0 1.1 (tup 2 3 4) (tup 5 6 7))
</div></div>
      
      <p>
      Again, the execution isn't very interesting to see, but under-the-hood,
      we're assigning the value <tt>[0 1.1 [2 3 4] [5 6 7]]</tt> to the entire space (and
      therefore, each of devices).
      </p>

      </article>


      <article>
      <h1>Sensors and Actuators</h1>
      <p>
      Sensors and actuators are the inputs and outputs (respectively) to the
      Proto program.
      </p>

      <p>
      We have pre-defined a set of test sensors for simulating a boolean
      sensor (e.g., button-press, motion sensor, etc.).  In code they look like
      <tt>(sense i)</tt> where <tt>i</tt> is the <i>ith</i> sensor.  To
      activate the sensor(s) in the simulator, select the device upon which
      you want to activate the sensor.  The device should then be surrounded by
      a translucent highlight.
      </p>

      <img src="figures/selectedNode.png" width="50%" />
      
      <p>
      Then, hit one of sensor keys:
      </p>
      <table border="1px">
         <tr> <td> <b>Key</b> </td> <td> <b>Sensor Proto Code</b> </td> <td> <b>Color of Device</b> </td> </tr>
         <tr> <td> t </td> <td> <tt>(sense 1)</tt> </td> <td> orange </td> </tr>
         <tr> <td> y </td> <td> <tt>(sense 2)</tt> </td> <td> purple </td> </tr>
         <tr> <td> u </td> <td> <tt>(sense 3)</tt> </td> <td> magenta </td> </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      You should see the device's color change when the sensor is enabled.
      </p>

      <img src="figures/sensorEnabled.png" width="50%" />
      
      <p>
      Try toggling sensor number one on some nodes in the example below:
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="sensorsAndActuators" class="editor">;;Sensors and Actuators
(if
   (sense 1)  ;; If sensor number 1 is enabled,
   (blue 1)   ;; turn on the blue LED
   (blue 0))  ;; otherwise, turn off the blue LED
</div></div>

      <p>
      You'll notice that the example also makes use of an actuator, <tt>(blue i)</tt>.
      The blue actuator toggles a blue LED with the brightness of the LED
      being indicated by <i>i</i>, a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Play around with the <tt>blue</tt> actuator a bit.  There are also
      <tt>red</tt> and <tt>green</tt> actuators that behave identically.
      Note that, using the color actuators together results in a "blending" of
      the colors (think RGB style blending).  What color do you think should
      be produced by the following program?
      </p>
      
<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="colorblending" class="editor">;;Color Blending
(all
   (blue 0.5)    ;; turn on the blue LED, half-brightness
   (green 0.5))  ;; turn on the green LED, half-brightness
</div></div>

      <p>
      There is also an actuator to control the movement of devices in Proto,
      <tt>mov</tt>.  Pass <tt>mov</tt> a tuple which represents its velocity
      (in x, y, z directions respectively).
      </p>
      
<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="movement" class="editor">;;Movement
(mov            ;; Move with velocity
   (tup 1 2 3)) ;; x=1 m/s, y=2 m/s, z=3 m/s
</div></div>

      <h1>Spatial Restriction</h1>
      <p>
      Let's say we want some lucky points we select to enable their blue LED, while
      the others remain the default color.  How would we accomplish that?  The
      answer is <i>spatial restriction</i>, but that's just one feature of
      Proto's control-flow.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Control Flow</h2>
      <p>
      <tt>(all statement1 statement2 ... statementN)</tt>: 
      All statements (1-n) are evaluated in parallel and the value of the last
      statement isreturned.  We'll use <tt>all</tt> a lot for executing multiple
      statements.
      </p>
      
<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="allexample" class="editor">;;All Example
(all
   (blue 1)    ;; turns blue LED on at highest brightness
   (green 1))  ;; turns green LED on at highest brightness
               ;; ... this should produce cyan
</div></div>

      <p>
      <tt>(mux test true-branch false-branch)</tt>: 
      Evaluates both true and false expressions. When test is true, returns
      the result of the true expression, otherwise returns the result of the
      false expression.  The true and false expressions must return the same
      type.
      </p>
      <p>
      <tt>(if test true-branch false-branch)</tt>: 
      Restricts execution to subspaces based on test. Where test is true, the
      true expression is evaluated; where test is false, the false expression
      is evaluated.  The true and false expressions must return the same type.
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="restriction" class="editor">;;Spatial Restriction
(if
   (sense 1)  ;; conditional statement
   (blue 1)   ;; executed when conditional evaluates to true
   (green 1))  ;; executed when conditional evaluates to false
</div></div>

      <p>
      There is an important distinction here between <tt>mux</tt> and
      <tt>if</tt>.  The difference is that, while <tt>if</tt> only evaluates
      the <i>true</i> branch, <tt>mux</tt> evaluates both the <i>true</i>
      <b>AND</b> <i>false</i> branches.  That doesn't seem very important, but
      it is, especially when the branches contain actuators.  What do you
      think will happen in the following program (all we've done is changed
      the <tt>if</tt> to a <tt>mux</tt>)?
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="muxvsif" class="editor">;;Mux vs. If
(mux

      <h1>Functions and Variables</h1>
      <p>
      Functions are a way of naming and re-using a behavior.  They are great
      for code maintainability and readability.
      </p>
      <p>
      Proto doesn't really have <i>variables</i>, like some other programing
      languages.  However, like variables, there is a way to assign a name to a value,
      but unlike traditional variables, the value can never change.
      </p>

      <h2>Scope and Bindings</h2>
      <p>
      Proto is a lexically scoped language. Names are not case sensitive. Bindings
      contain values and are looked up by name. Lexical bindings are visible only within the scope in which they
      are bound, and shadow bindings of the same name from enclosing scopes.
      </p>

      <p>
      <tt>(def function-name (arg1 arg2 ... argN) body-branch)</tt>:
      Define a function name in the current scope, with as many arguments as
      there are arg identifiers. The body-branch is evaluated within an
      extended scope where the arg identifiers are bound to arguments to the
      function. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <tt>(fun (arg1 arg2 ... argN) body-branch)</tt>, is similar to <tt>def</tt> but
      creates anonymous functions &mdash; hense the lack of the function-name parameter.
      </p>

      <p>
      <tt>(let ((var1 value1) (var2 value2) ... (varN valueN)) body-branch)</tt>: 
      Extends scope, binding all var identifiers to their associated value in
      parallel. The body is evaluated in the extended scope. <tt>let*</tt> is
      like let, except that identifies are bound sequentially, so later ones
      can use earlier ones in their definition.
      </p>

      <h1>Thinking about Space</h1>
      <p>
      Space is a big part of what Proto is about.  Most of the programs that
      you write in Proto will manipulate space, doing things like naming
      regions of space, measuring distances, and moving information around from
      place to place.  Proto is designed to make this easy by letting you
      work with <i>fields</i>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A field assigns values to every point in a space.  For example, let's
      say our space is a rectangular room, with an air conditioner over on the
      left wall and the sun streaming through the windows on the right wall.
      We can view the temperature in the room as a field: every location in
      the room has a temperature, and the temperature may be different from
      place to place.  The figure below shows a temperature field,
      shading from coldest (shown as blue) to warmest (shown as red).  The
      field is the whole collection of temperature values, each associated
      with its location.
      </p>

      <img src="figures/heatmap.png" width="50%" />
      
      <p>
      Of course, we may not get to measure temperature everywhere.  If we
      only have a few devices, and we build our network by scattering them
      around the room, then we get something more like what is shown
      below.
      </p>
      
      <img src="figures/heatmap-discrete.png" width="50%" />
      
      <p>
      Now, say you've acquired the field depicted above,
      <tt>(temperature)</tt>, that lists the temperature at each point in
      space and you want to perform some operation on the field.  For
      instance, let's say you want to know all the places where the
      temperature is over 25 degrees Celsius.  In Proto, it's as simple as
      saying <tt>(> (temperature) 25)</tt>.  Graphically, it would look
      something like this:
      </p>

      <p>
      What's important to know is two things:
      (1) The more devices that we have, the better that they approximate
      space; and
      (2) Some programs need better approximations than others, but a lot
      of programs will work well with very crude approximations.
      </p>

      <p>
      A big part of the trick of writing good Proto programs is to think
      about the space, while remembering that it will be approximated.

      <h1>Using Space</h1>

      <p>
      Now let's start writing some programs that work with space in more
      complicated ways.  Take a look at this code:
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="close" class="editor">;;Using Space
(def close (src)
   (let ((d (distance-to src)))
      (if (and (< d 10) (> d 1))
         (blue 1)
         (blue 0))))

(close (sense 1))
</div></div>

      <p>
      There are several new things in this code. For instance, the <tt>let</tt>
      assigns the variables inside it to a value.  In this
      <tt>let</tt> statement, the variable <tt>d</tt> is set as the distance to the
      source.
      The function <tt>distance-to</tt>, as its name suggests, gives each
      device its own value of estimated distance to the source. 
      </p>

      <p> 
      If we execute this program, and turn on <tt>sense 1</tt> for a few
      devices, you will see that only devices within a very small select range
      from the source turn on their blue LED.  If you turn on <tt>sense
      1</tt> on a fairly isolated device, you might not have any of the
      surrounding device LEDs turn blue at all.  The program tells each device
      to figure out their distance to the <tt>sense 1</tt> device(s), which they
      should call <tt>d</tt>, and that if their individual value of <tt>d</tt> is
      less than ten meters and greater than one meter, then they may turn
      their LEDs blue.  Otherwise, the LEDs remain blank.  Try
      expanding this range of blue LEDs by increasing the first parameter of
      the <tt>and</tt> statement.
      </p>

      <h1>Refining Space</h1>
      <p>
      The previous example shows how to select several close nodes, but what if we
      wanted to be more precise in our selection?  What if, instead of taking three
      points or no points, based on how close the randomly placed points were to the
      src, we wanted just a single closest point, no matter how far or close it is
      to the src?  This is where the <tt>nbr</tt> and the <tt>hood</tt> functions come
      in.  These functions are used to tell a device exactly where each point within
      its communication range is relative to itself and what values these neighbors
      have calculated, giving the device fields of points and values to work with.
      Using these functions, we can select the point(s) that we want accurately.
      This demonstrates that ability:
      </p>

<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="closest" class="editor">;;Refining Space
(def closest (src)
   (let ((d (distance-to src))
         (min-d (broadcast src 
                 (min-hood+ (nbr (distance-to src))))))
     (if (and (not (= min-d (inf)))
              (= min-d d))
         (blue 1)
         (blue 0))))

(closest (sense 1))
</div></div>
<p>
This code is built to light up the device LED that is closest to the
<tt>src</tt> (source) blue, and it introduces a wide variety of new
functions. 
</p>

<p>
We see our <tt>let</tt> operation again, except this time it defines two
separate variables instead of just one.  The first one we know
already: variable <tt>d</tt> is the distance to the source device. The
second definition is where most of the confusing bit comes in.
</p>

<p>
We are trying to assign the value of the shortest distance to the
source to our new variable <tt>min-d</tt> (minimum distance).  Let's work
from the inside parentheses out in this definition.  First, we have
our <tt>(distance-to src)</tt>.  Note that you cannot use the predefined
<tt>d</tt> here, because <tt>let</tt> defines everything at once, and so
Proto will not recognize this variable as being already defined.
Now that each device has established its
own distance value (which happens to be the same as <tt>d</tt>).  The
<tt>nbr</tt> function gathers up these values from each device's
neighborhood, returning a field that maps each point in the
neighborhood to a distance value.  All the functions starting with
<tt>nbr</tt> in the Proto Language Reference create fields of values
assigned to neighboring devices.  In fact, instead of putting
<tt>(nbr (distance-to src))</tt> here, one could instead put
<tt>(nbr-range)</tt>, which again assigns a field of distances to
neighbors, with the same outcome since for this program we only care
about neighbors of the <tt>src</tt>.  The <tt>min-hood+</tt> function takes
all of these values returned by <tt>nbr</tt> as pairs, (neighbor,
distance away), and then takes the minimum "distance away" value as
its return value.  This is important: because of the <tt>+</tt> at the end
of <tt>min-hood</tt>, the device excludes its own value from the calculation.
Were this not the case, the closest device to itself would always be
itself.
</p>

<center><img src="figures/nbr-d.png" width="30%" /></center>

<p>
The broadcast function sends information from the <tt>src</tt> devices to
all of the other devices.  If there is one <tt>src</tt> device, then
every device ends up with the same value; if there is more than one
<tt>src</tt> device, then every device ends up with the value from the
nearest <tt>src</tt> device.  Here, in our <tt>closest</tt> function, we
are using broadcast to have the <tt>src</tt> tell every other device
what the closest device to itself is.  Every device computes the
<tt>min-hood+</tt> expression, to find out how close is its closest neighbor 
(besides itself) to the source.  Only the <tt>src</tt> devices send the value.
</p>
<p>
The main part of this function, (after the <tt>let</tt>) is actually
quite simple.  All it does is have each device ask itself, ``Is my
distance to the source equal to the minimum distance to the source,
and is the minimum distance to the source not infinity? If so, turn
LED blue; if not, leave LED blank.''  This part: <tt>(not (= min-d (inf)))</tt> stops the devices from automatically turning blue, because
before any source is identified, the minimum distance to the source is
infinite, and all the devices' <tt>d</tt> variables are also infinite and
therefore equal to <tt>min-d</tt>.  This test tells the program to wait
until a <tt>src</tt> exists, which will cause <tt>min-d</tt> become finite.
Remember that if you want to look over any of the <tt>nbr</tt>,
<tt>hood</tt>, <tt>broadcast</tt> or <tt>not</tt> functions, or even how to
use constants such as <tt>inf</tt>, you can find them all in the Proto
Language Reference.
</p>
<p>
When executed, this produces a field of devices, shown as little red
dots.  Right now, all the devices know that <tt>min-d</tt> is equal to
infinity, and therefore all their LEDs are off.  Turn <tt>sense 1</tt>
on on any device.  After a few seconds, a blue LED goes on on the
closest device to the <tt>src</tt>, no matter how close or far that
device may be.  You can turn <tt>sense 1</tt> on or off at several
devices, and their closest neighbors' LEDs will turn on or off
accordingly, since the <tt>broadcast</tt> is taking the value from the
<i>nearest</i> source.  Take note, however,
that if you isolate a <tt>sense 1</tt> device to the point that all
other points are outside of its radio-range, no <tt>min-d</tt> can be
found.  Also, turning on two <tt>sense 1</tt> devices close together may
allow only a single <tt>min-d</tt> value (depending on where exactly the
closest neighbors are), so only one of the sensed points may light up
its closest neighbor.  Similarly, if a <tt>sense 1</tt> device is with
direct communication range of another <tt>sense 1</tt> device, both will
light their LEDs, since they both see the other being zero distance
from the <tt>src</tt>.

      <h1>Thinking in Time</h1>
      <p>
      In Proto, as with any programming language, time is an important part
      of its programs.  The simulator 
      clock is always running unless, of course, you pause the simulator (using the space-bar).
      In Proto, our timers will not run in actual seconds, but will run at
      whatever rate Proto is managing to run through its program.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Now we will start working with time directly in our programs as well.
      Let's start by setting a simple timer on every device, and having
      them turn on their red LED after 300 simulated seconds.
      </p>
      
<div class="editorwrapper">
<div id="timer" class="editor">;;Timer
(def timer () 
  (rep t 0 (+ t (dt))))

(if (> (timer) 300)
  (red 1)
  0)
</div></div>

<p>
There are a two new functions in here: <tt>rep</tt> and <tt>dt</tt>.  Both
are defined on page 5 of the Proto Language Reference.  Take a look at
the form of <tt>rep</tt>.  The <tt>rep</tt> function creates a variable,
just like <tt>let</tt>, but the variable created by <tt>rep</tt> is used to
remember information from round to round of the program.  In this
case, we use the function <tt>rep</tt> to create the feedback variable
<tt>t</tt>, which will store elapsed time and has the initial value of 0.
The third argument, <tt>(+ t (dt))</tt>, tells the how the value changes
over time&mdash;how it ``evolves.''  In this case, Proto reads that every
time it runs through this code, it should add one <tt>(dt)</tt> to the
current time.  What is one <tt>dt</tt>?  This <tt>dt</tt> value is the
amount of time elapsed between rounds in a program.  So we essentially
add the time of one round every time we go through a round.  The whole
<tt>rep</tt> expression then returns the value of <tt>t</tt>.  We can also
make more complicated feedback functions using <tt>letfed</tt>, which can
make more than one feedback variable and allows you to use them in a
further part of the program just like variables from a <tt>let</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Because this "timer" program is used so frequently, it has it's
own special operation, <tt>(timer)</tt>.
