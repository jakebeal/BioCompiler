Before making a public release, please go down this checklist:
- run ./prepare-release.sh to set the KERNEL_VERSION and PROTO_VERSION
- Check that all regression tests are passing
- Make sure all configure.ac files have the right release number in AC_INIT
- Update the release number in proto/man/src/proto-docs.sty
- Make sure all recent authors are credited in proto/AUTHORS and 
  proto/man/src/proto-docs.sty (and any other AUTHOR lists)
- Make sure copyright goes through current year
- Re-LaTex all manuals
- Make sure all significant changes are listed in proto/NEWS
- Use 'svn copy' to tag the release version
- Use 'svn export' to create a clean copy, then tar it to proto-releaseN.tgz
