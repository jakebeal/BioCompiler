Responsible Proto development means that every time you change
something in a release directory you should do the following things
before checking in the code:

1. Update README files and manuals, as appropriate
   In manuals, things may be marked with "\bugs{}" "\broken{}"
   or "\experimental{}" when they aren't working right.
2. Add regression tests to verify that your changes work
3. Follow the style of existing code:
   - Start every file with the standard licensing header
   - Code should be dense but readable
     - Keep lines to 80 characters
     - indent with 2 spaces / indent
     - Short comment go on the same line as code
   - Each file should contain a single, whole, thematically coherent
     module: this isn't Java so lots of little files aren't mandatory
   - Use Unix-style newlines

Doing these immediately will help prevent version skew and
accumulation of small tasks into large & painful tasks.

Small upgrades and bug-fixes can be registered through the
bug-tracker at http://proto.bbn.com/bugzilla/.
To act as a full developer, you will need access to the subversion
repository.  Email proto-leadership@csail.mit.edu with a case for
access if you think you need it, and we'll set you up with access to
the repository and bug tracker.
