This project contains a simple example of how to build a plugin for
MIT Proto.  This is intended to serve as a template, aiding you in
developing your own plugins, so it is released in the public domain.
For full documentation on plugins and how to build them, see your
Proto developer manual.

This example project uses GNU autotools, so if you have already
installed MIT Proto, you should be able to build it by running:
  `./autogen.sh; ./configure; make; make install'

Test the plugin by running:
  proto -DD foo-dist -l -TM foo-time -L foo-layer "(green (+ (foo (sense 1)) (rep t 0 (+ 0.1 t))))"
This should result in a spiral (foo-dist) of green dots shooting up,
with farther dots rising faster (foo-time).  If you turn on (sense 1),
the dots will jump up and down (foo-layer)


Key files in this directory:
  Makefile.am			Declaration of the project
  ExampleDistribution.h/.cpp	Example of a distribution for scattering devices
  ExampleTimeModel.h/.cpp	Example of a clock implementation
  ExampleLayer.h/.cpp		Example of a simulator & kernel extension
  ExamplePlugin.h/.cpp		Plugin containing names and glue code for
  				using the distribution, clock, and extension
  autogen.sh			Processes Makefile.am, setting up project 
  				to be ready for building
  configure.ac			Project description used by autogen.sh

Note that building the project will create a large number of
automatically generated or copied files.  Most of these should not be
included in any distribution of your plugin; see the GNU autotools
documentation for more details.
