For a long time, one of the barrier to Proto adoption has been its
lisp-like syntax.  This is somewhat ridiculous, but the fact remains:
lots of people don't like parentheses and have a hard time thinking in
prefix notation.  Thus, we would like to offer a "skin" on the
language that makes it look and feel more like some other popular
language, but without losing the underlying semantics or changing the
expressiveness (in either direction).  

It would be ideal if we could implement the "skin" simply as a
syntactic transformation from the alternate language into Proto.  The
popular imperative candidates I have been considering as bases for the
syntax are: C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.  I ended up going
with Python as a first candidate for two reasons: it has a nicely
sparse syntax and it's still all new and shiny as a language.

The key insight (surely unoriginal) that will allow our
transformation, is that assignment can be mapped onto let.  So, for
example, the assignments:

  a = 3 + x;
  b = a*(a+1);
  c = b - sqrt(a);

can be rewritten in Proto as:

  (let ((a (+ 3 x)))
    (let ((b (* a (+ a 1))))
      (let ((c (- b (sqrt a))))
        ...
        )))

This can work for re-assignment too, using shadowing:
  a = 3 + x;
  a = a + 1;
  
  can be rewritten as:
  (let ((a (+ 3 x)))
    (let ((a (+ a 1)))
      ...
      ))

If we allow assignment to happen inside of "if" statements, though, it
gets ugly.  And of course iteration would make life difficult.  So to
keep things simple, we'll probably just have it be the case that
you're only allowed to assign a variable once within a given scope.
So, no shadowing, but in return no dealing with the "not really an
assigment" confusion that I think would result otherwise.

On this basis, we can build "Pyto" by doing the following:
- math operators (e.g. +, *) are done in standard math notation
- other pointwise ops go: (op arg arg ...) -> op(arg,arg,...)
- neighborhood operations are trated just like pointwise
- (def name (arg arg ...) body) --> 
  function name (arg, arg, ...) {
    body
  }
- (letfed ((var1 init1 update1) (var2 init2 update2) ...) body) -->
  feedback var1, var2, ... {
      var1 = init1;
      var2 = init2;
  } update {
      var1 = update1;
      var2 = update2;
  };
- (if test expr1 expr2) -->
  if(test) { expr1; } else { expr2; }
  also the ternary: (test ? expr1 : expr2)
- (mux test expr1 expr2) -->
  mux { expr1; } and { expr2; } select(test);
  also a ternary: (expr1 \ expr2 ? test)
- the last statement in a block is always the return value
- Tuple elements can be accessed with []
  (elt mytuple 0) --> 
  mytuple[0] 
  also the old way: elt(mytuple,0)
- Tuples can be constructed with {}
  let((mytuple (tup 1 2 3))) -->
  mytuple = {1, 2, 3};
  also the old way: mytuple = tuple(1,2,3);


We also need to change some things about symbols, since lisproto
allows all sorts of things in symbols, but cpproto needs to
reserve most of these symbols for infix notation.
To that end, we will do the following:
1) In cpproto, only alphanumeric and "_" are allowed in symbols.
2) If a symbol starts with "$", then everything allowed by lisproto
   until the next whitespace is taken as part of the symbol.
3) cpproto symbols with "_" are implicitly converted to "-" when
   referencing lisproto code.  A warning is emitted for this.
4) The core library will have "_" as well as "-" versions of core ops.
5) lisproto will have "." removed from legitimate symbol characters.

The *-hood+ ops (e.g. min-hood+) still need a better name, though.
