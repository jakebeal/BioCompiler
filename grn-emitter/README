This is the TASBE BioCompiler plugin for Proto, release #0.

This project uses GNU autotools, so if you have already installed MIT
Proto, you should be able to build it by running:
  `./autogen.sh; ./configure; make; make install'

Test the plugin by changing to the tests directory and running:
    prototest.py *.test

Visualizing the dotfiles requires GraphViz 2.30 or higher, which
is when the SBOL visual icons were introduced.

Some configuration notes:
- if you want to emit without a need for 2A sequences linking proteins,
  then run BioCompiler with the option '--single-products-only'
